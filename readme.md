#SF Process Launcher

Launches and monitors processes and dependant processes.

So, if you have a business app, and whenever it's running you want a screen scraper ALSO running, that is automatically restarted when it crashes (because it's a buggy app), this is the app for you!

See ProcessLauncherConfig.xml for an example configuration. The configuration file must be either next to the executable, or provided as the first argument in the form of a full path.
